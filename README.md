# VRC-OSC Scripts
This is a little repo to leave all of my Open Sound Control (OSC) Programs for VRChat. It's all public to use, just don't be annoying in public worlds with it. <br/>
<br/>
# Installs:
Most of the programs have libraries that Python does not have built-in, so you will have to install them.<br/><br/>
pip install **python_weather** <br/>
pip install **asyncio** <br/>
pip install **websockets**<br/>
pip install **json**<br/>
pip install **argparse**<br/>
