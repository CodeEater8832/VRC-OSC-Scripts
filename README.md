# VRC-OSC Scripts
This is a little repo to leave all of my Open Sound Control (OSC) Programs for VRChat. It's all public to use, just don't be annoying in public worlds with it. 

# Installs:
Most of the programs have libraries that Python does not have built-in, so you will have to install them.

**asyncio** 
**websockets**
