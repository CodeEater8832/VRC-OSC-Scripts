# VRC-OSC Scripts
This is a little repo to leave all of my Open Sound Control (OSC) Programs for VRChat. It's all public to use, just don't be annoying in public worlds with it. <br/>
<br/>
# Installs:
Most of the programs have libraries that Python does not have built-in, so you will have to install them.<br/>
**python_weather** <br/>
**asyncio** <br/>
**websockets**<br/>
**json**<br/>
**argparse**<br/>
